Completion plugin for jEdit.

Many different plugins offer their own code completion functionality.

This makes it difficult or impossible to simultaneously get code completion hints from all or more than one plugin.

This plugin accepts code completion services offered by other plugins.

As a practical example, with a single shortcut, I'm offered completion hints from the following plugins at the same time:
HaXeSidekick
SuperAbbreves
CtagsInterface
TextAutocomplete
